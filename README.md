# 🛠️ 𝚝𝟷 — Real-time proofs to unify Ethereum

𝚝𝟷 is a rollup that introduces real-time proofs to unify Ethereum and the rollup ecosystem.

## 📂 Directory Structure

This monorepo encompasses essential infrastructure components of the 𝚝𝟷 protocol, including Solidity contracts, rollup node in Rust, and comprehensive end-to-end tests.

- 🧑‍💻 **[contracts](./contracts/README.md)**: Solidity contracts (L1/L2 bridges, rollup & pre-deployed contracts)
  - 📚 **[tutorial](./contracts/TUTORIAL.md)**: Step-by-step guide for building on 𝚝𝟷
- 🦀 **[reth](./reth/README.md)**: Rust-based 𝚝𝟷 extension for reth
- 🧪 **[e2e](./e2e/README.md)**: End-to-end testing suite for protocol validation

## 🚧 Quick Start
